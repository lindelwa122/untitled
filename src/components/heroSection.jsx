                    <p>I just wanted to take a moment and say it has been 158 days since we met. I never thought a friendship could mean this much in such a short period of time, but here we are.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for being there when I needed someone. Thank you for being my friend. Every day, I look forward to coming to campus because of you.</p>
